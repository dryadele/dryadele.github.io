Recently, I started writing about random stuffs and posted on Facebook. I surprisingly found myself enjoy writing here and there even though my writing skill is not that good and through my entire educational period I never once like to study literature. I want to store all of my thoughts and feelings somewhere that nobody knows that is me. Facebook is not a good place at all, so here I am, create a Gmail then a Github account just to host a blog.

If someone stumbles upon my blog, hope you enjoy it.
